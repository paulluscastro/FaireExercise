# **Faire Backend Exercise**

Project made to attend Faire's challenge on using Faire's API.
___
### Faire Backend Exercise
 Using the **Faire API**, you will write a program that accepts an API key as a single command line parameter, which should be sent with all requests in the X-FAIRE-ACCESS-TOKEN header, and does the following:
- Consumes all products for a given brand*2, recording the inventory levels for each product option
- Consumes all orders, accepting the order if there is inventory to fulfill the order and it is not already accepted, otherwise it marks the items that donâ€™t have enough inventory as backordered
- Update the inventory levels of product options as each order is moved to processing
- After all orders have been read, the program should print the following metrics, plus 2 of your choosing, and then exit - your creativity is welcome!-
	-   The best selling product option
	-   The largest order by dollar amount
	-   The state with the most orders

### How to run
To run the project you will need:
- Java 1.8
- Maven

Download the contents and run the application with the following command:
`mvn clean compile exec:java -Dkey=<KEY>`

Where **KEY** is the API Key provided by Faire.
